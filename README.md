## 📌 About This Portfolio

This portfolio documents my progression through hands-on cybersecurity coursework, labs, and independent projects, with a focus on:

- Incident response and SOC-style investigations
- Vulnerability assessment and risk analysis using CVE and CVSS concepts
- Digital forensics and file system artifact analysis
- Network and wireless security testing
- Cloud and identity-based security using Microsoft Azure
- Home lab security deployments and operational automation

All public material is **sanitized** to avoid exposing sensitive data while still demonstrating technical methodology, analytical thinking, and decision-making.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Pi-hole Home DNS Deployment
**Goal:** Reduce ad/tracker traffic while maintaining reliability across a production home network.

**Highlights:**
- Deployed Pi-hole as primary DNS resolver
- Tuned blocklists to avoid overblocking
- Monitored DNS logs to identify noisy or misconfigured clients
- Automated maintenance tasks (updates, gravity refresh, cache cleanup)

### 🔹 Incident Response Log Analysis & IOC Extraction
**Goal:** Extract actionable indicators of compromise from structured log data.

**Highlights:**
- Parsed JSON-based security logs
- Identified suspicious IPs, domains, files, processes, and ports
- Focused on analyst-ready output (not raw data dumps)
- Documented findings and recommended response actions
